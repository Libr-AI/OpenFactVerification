As Loki continues to evolve, our development plan focuses on broadening capabilities and enhancing flexibility to meet the diverse needs of our users. Here are the key areas we are working on:

## 1. Support for Multiple Models
- **Broader Model Compatibility:**
  - Integration with leading AI models besides ChatGPT and Claude to diversify fact-checking capabilities, including Command R and Gemini.
  - Implementation of self-hosted model options for enhanced privacy and control, e.g., FastChat, TGI, and vLLM.

## 2. Model-specific Prompt Engineering
- **Unit Testing for Prompts:**
  - Develop robust unit tests for each step to ensure prompt reliability and accuracy across different scenarios.

## 3. Expanded Search Engine Support
- **Diverse Search Engines:**
  - Incorporate a variety of search engines including Bing, scraperapi to broaden search capabilities.
  - Integration with [Searxng](https://github.com/searxng/searxng), an open-source metasearch engine.
  - Support for specialized indexes like LlamaIndex and Langchain, and the ability to search local documents.

## 4. Deployment and Scalability
- **Dockerization:**
  - Packaging Loki into Docker containers to simplify deployment and scale-up operations, ensuring Loki can be easily set up and maintained across different environments.

## 5. Multi-language Support
- **Language Expansion:**
  - Support for additional languages beyond English, including Chinese, Arabic, etc, to cater to a global user base.


We are committed to these enhancements to make Loki not just more powerful, but also more adaptable to the needs of a global user base. Stay tuned as we roll out these exciting developments!
