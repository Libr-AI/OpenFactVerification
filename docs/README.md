# OpenFactVerification Documentation

Welcome to the OpenFactVerification (Loki) documentation! This repository contains the codebase for the Loki project, which is a fact-checking pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art language models to verify the veracity of textual claims. The pipeline is designed to be modular, allowing users to easily customize the evidence retrieval, language model, and prompt used in the fact-checking process.
