# Loki: An Open-source Tool for Fact Verification

## Overview
Loki is our open-source solution designed to automate the process of verifying factuality. It provides a comprehensive pipeline for dissecting long texts into individual claims, assessing their worthiness for verification, generating queries for evidence search, crawling for evidence, and ultimately verifying the claims. This tool is especially useful for journalists, researchers, and anyone interested in the factuality of information. To stay updated, please subscribe to our newsletter at [our website](https://www.librai.tech/) or join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NRge6RS7)!

## Components
- **Decomposer:** Breaks down extensive texts into digestible, independent claims, setting the stage for detailed analysis.
- **Checkworthy:** Assesses each claim's potential significance, filtering out vague or ambiguous statements to focus on those that truly matter. For example, vague claims like "MBZUAI has a vast campus" are considered unworthy because of the ambiguous nature of "vast."
- **Query Generator:** Transforms check-worthy claims into precise queries, ready to navigate the vast expanse of the internet in search of truth.
- **Evidence Crawler:** Ventures into the digital realm, retrieving relevant evidence that forms the foundation of informed verification.
- **ClaimVerify:** Examines the gathered evidence, determining the veracity of each claim to uphold the integrity of information.

## Quick Start
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or newer
- Required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Libr-AI/OpenFactVerification.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:
```bash
cd factcheckservice
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure api keys

```
cp factcheck/config/secret_dict.template factcheck/config/secret_dict.py
```
You can choose to export essential api key to the environment, or configure it in `factcheck/config/secret_dict.py`.

- Example: Export essential api key to the environment
```bash
export SERPER_API_KEY=... # this is required in evidence retrieval if serper being used
export OPENAI_API_KEY=... # this is required in all tasks
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... # this is required only if you want to replace openai with anthropic
```

### Test

<p align="center"><img src="./fig/cmd_example.gif"/></p>

To test the project, you can run the `factcheck.py` script:
```bash
# String
python factcheck.py --modal string --input "MBZUAI is the first AI university in the world"
# Text
python factcheck.py --modal text --input demo_data/text.txt
# Speech
python factcheck.py --modal speech --input demo_data/speech.mp3
# Image
python factcheck.py --modal image --input demo_data/image.webp
# Video
python factcheck.py --modal video --input demo_data/video.m4v
```

## Usage

The main interface of the Fact-check Pipeline is located in `factcheck/core/FactCheck.py`, which contains the `check_response` method. This method integrates the complete pipeline, where each functionality is encapsulated in its class as described in the Features section.

Example usage:
```python
from factcheck.core.FactCheck import check_response

# Example text
text = "Your text here"

# Run the fact-check pipeline
results = check_response(text)
print(results)
```

Web app usage:
```bash
python webapp.py
```
